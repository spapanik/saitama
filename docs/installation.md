# Installation

The easiest way is to use [pipx] to install `saitama`.

```console
$ pipx install saitama
```

This is the only officially supported way of installing it.

Alternatively, you can install it with [pip]:

```console
$ pip install --user saitama
```

The biggest issue with this approach is that you won't have an isolated
environment for `saitama`, therefore you might run into dependency
conflicts, and so this is neither recommended nor supported.
